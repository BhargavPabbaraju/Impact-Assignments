    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed in a structured manner to facilitate efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. It provides a structured way to store and organize large amounts of information, allowing for efficient querying and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, querying languages, and underlying storage architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "- SQL databases are based on the relational data model, where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas and relationships between tables.\n",
    "- They use SQL as a standard language for defining and manipulating the data. SQL provides powerful capabilities for querying, updating, and managing relational data.\n",
    "- SQL databases enforce ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "- They are well-suited for structured and tabular data, and commonly used in applications that require complex querying, data consistency, and transactional support.\n",
    "- Popular SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "- NoSQL databases are designed to handle large-scale, unstructured, and semi-structured data. They provide flexible schemas and allow for dynamic and agile data models.\n",
    "- They employ various data models, including key-value stores, document databases, columnar databases, and graph databases. Each data model offers specific advantages depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of the application.\n",
    "- NoSQL databases often provide APIs or query languages specific to their data model. Some NoSQL databases may support SQL-like querying as well.\n",
    "- They are highly scalable and can handle massive amounts of data and high traffic loads. They are commonly used in web applications, real-time analytics, and distributed systems.\n",
    "- NoSQL databases may sacrifice some of the ACID properties in favor of scalability, availability, and performance.\n",
    "- Popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase.\n"

    "# Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of relational databases, a Primary Key and a Foreign Key are both important concepts related to establishing relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Primary Key:\n",
    "A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It ensures the uniqueness and integrity of the data in the table. Each table can have only one Primary Key. Some key characteristics of a Primary Key are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uniqueness: Each value in the Primary Key column(s) must be unique, meaning no two rows can have the same value for the Primary Key.\n",
    "- Non-nullability: The Primary Key column(s) cannot contain null values, ensuring that each row is uniquely identifiable.\n",
    "- Indexing: Primary Keys are typically indexed, which provides fast access and efficient searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a table named \"Students\" with a column \"StudentID\" as the Primary Key. Each StudentID value in the table will be unique, and it will uniquely identify each student record.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Foreign Key:\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the Primary Key of another table. It establishes a link or relationship between two tables, allowing data integrity and enforcing referential integrity rules. Some key characteristics of a Foreign Key are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Referential Integrity: A Foreign Key establishes a relationship between tables, ensuring that the values in the Foreign Key column(s) of one table correspond to the values in the Primary Key column(s) of another table.\n",
    "- Cascading Actions: Foreign Keys can define cascading actions such as \"ON DELETE\" and \"ON UPDATE\" to maintain data integrity when changes are made to the referenced Primary Key values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a table named \"Orders\" with a column \"CustomerID\" as a Foreign Key. The \"CustomerID\" column in the \"Orders\" table refers to the \"CustomerID\" Primary Key column in the \"Customers\" table, establishing a relationship between the two tables based on the customers' IDs.\n"
