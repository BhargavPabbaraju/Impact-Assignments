    "# Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Encapsulation:</u>  Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) within a class. It hides the internal implementation details of an object and provides access to the object's functionalities through well-defined interfaces. This helps in achieving data protection and code modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Inheritance:</u>  Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class. It enables code reuse and promotes the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. The class that is being inherited from is called the base class or superclass, and the class that inherits from it is called the derived class or subclass. The derived class can extend or override the functionalities inherited from the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Polymorphism:</u>  Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond in a unique way to the same method or message. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. Polymorphism enables code flexibility, modularity, and extensibility. It can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Abstraction:</u>  Abstraction involves representing complex real-world entities as simplified models in software. It focuses on the essential features and behaviors of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. Abstraction allows programmers to create abstract classes and interfaces that define common characteristics and behaviors for a group of related objects. It provides a level of abstraction, allowing developers to work with high-level concepts rather than dealing with low-level implementation details.\n"

    "# Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), self is a conventionally used parameter name that refers to the instance of a class. It is used to access the attributes and methods of an object within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self parameter acts as a reference to the object itself. When a method is called on an object, the object is automatically passed as the first argument to that method, and by convention, it is named self. This allows the method to operate on the specific instance of the class to which it belongs and access its attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using self within a class allows us to differentiate between instance variables (attributes specific to an object) and local variables (variables within a specific method). It helps in maintaining the state of an object by allowing access to the object's attributes and modifying them as needed."
