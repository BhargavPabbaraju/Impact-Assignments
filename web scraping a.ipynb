    "# Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "There are several methods and techniques used for web scraping. Here are some commonly employed approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Manual Copy-Pasting: This is the most basic and straightforward method of web scraping. It involves manually copying and pasting the desired data from a website into a local file or spreadsheet. While this approach is simple, it is time-consuming and not suitable for scraping large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regular Expression Matching: Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to identify and extract specific data from HTML or text documents. Web scrapers can utilize regex to search for and extract desired information based on predefined patterns, such as email addresses, phone numbers, or specific text structures. This method is useful for extracting structured data but may become complex when dealing with more diverse or dynamic web page structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. HTML Parsing: HTML parsing involves parsing the HTML structure of a web page using libraries or tools specifically designed for this purpose. Commonly used libraries include BeautifulSoup (Python), Jsoup (Java), or lxml (Python). These libraries enable developers to navigate and extract data from HTML elements using selectors like CSS or XPath. HTML parsing is flexible and can handle more complex web page structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Web Scraping Libraries and Frameworks: There are dedicated web scraping libraries and frameworks that provide high-level APIs and functionalities to simplify the scraping process. Some popular examples include Scrapy (Python), Selenium (multiple languages), and Puppeteer (JavaScript). These tools offer features such as automated navigation, handling of JavaScript-rendered pages, session management, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. API Access: Some websites provide Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow developers to access and retrieve data in a structured and controlled manner. APIs often provide endpoints that return data in JSON or XML formats, making it easier to integrate and extract specific information. Using APIs for data retrieval is generally more reliable and efficient than scraping web pages directly.\n",

    "# Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is widely used for web scraping and parsing HTML or XML documents. It provides a convenient and intuitive way to extract data from web pages by parsing the underlying structure of the HTML or XML code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is used for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. HTML Parsing: Beautiful Soup allows developers to parse and navigate the HTML structure of a web page easily. It handles imperfect and poorly formatted HTML, making it suitable for scraping data from real-world websites that may have inconsistencies. Beautiful Soup takes care of handling tag nesting, closing tags, and other intricacies of HTML parsing, simplifying the scraping process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Extraction: Beautiful Soup provides a range of methods and selectors to extract specific data from HTML elements. Developers can use methods like .find(), .find_all(), or CSS selectors to locate elements based on their tags, attributes, or textual content. This allows for targeted extraction of desired data, such as text, links, images, tables, or any other HTML element.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Traversing and Navigation: Beautiful Soup allows developers to traverse and navigate the parsed HTML tree structure. It provides methods to move up and down the tree, access parent, sibling, or child elements, and search for specific elements based on their relationships. This makes it easier to locate and extract data from specific sections of a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Integration with Python: Beautiful Soup is a Python library, making it highly compatible and easily integrated with other Python libraries and frameworks. It can be seamlessly combined with other tools such as requests for making HTTP requests, pandas for data manipulation and analysis, or data storage libraries to save scraped data in various formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Flexibility and Customization: Beautiful Soup offers flexibility in terms of how data is extracted and processed. It allows developers to define custom filters, callbacks, or functions to handle specific parsing or extraction requirements. This level of customization enables developers to adapt the scraping process to the specific needs of the target website.\n",
